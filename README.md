### pyQt Visualizer of simulation outputs

This little Qt interface was used during my PhD thesis to visualize simulations outputs saved in specific repo structure in the form ofpreprocessed images. 
The interface include buttons to move across parameter spaces and display a map of the parameter space with the current position and the related simulation outputs. 
Simulation outputs need to be preprocessed and saved as images so that the visualization is fast enough to provide decent user experience. 

System requirements:
- Needs a environment with python 2.7 (use pyenv or virtualenv).
- Library dependencies:  PyQt4, h5py, numpy, matplotlib
